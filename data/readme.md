All data was originally from:

pqrs.csv - a simplified version of the CMS individual provider quality scores. The first column is the NPI of the provider and then there are six optional scores. This file is only included for reference.

src.csv - this is the pqrs.csv file merged with everything from the Physician Compare National Downloadable File. Because that file was 600MB and had a lot of providers without scores, I joined the two and kept them in one smaller CSV.
